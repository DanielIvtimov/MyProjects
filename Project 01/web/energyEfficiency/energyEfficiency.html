                        Energy efficiency is the performance of the same or greater amount of activities with the same
                        or less amount of consumed energy (thermal, light, kinetic) and with less emission of carbon
                        dioxide into the atmosphere.

                    <h2>WHAT IS RENEWABLE ENERGY?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Renewable energy is energy that is renewed quickly through natural processes. Renewable energy
                        sources are sun, wind, water, geothermal or biomass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The advantage of these resources is that they are in unlimited quantities and their use does not
                        pollute the environment.
                    </p>
                    <h2>ENERGY EFFICIENT CARPENTRY</h2>
                    <p>
                        Windows, doors and skylights are an integral part of residential buildings, the window is a
                        mandatory opening of the building with the basic function of letting daylight into the interior
                        of the building and enabling natural ventilation of the premises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The total losses through the windows is 50% of the building's heat loss. They are usually ten
                        times greater than the heat loss through the walls, which is why the importance of
                        energy-efficient windows in the total energy needs of the building is clear. In addition to
                        reducing heating costs, energy-efficient windows contribute to increasing the comfort of living
                        and working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the windows and doors are made of materials that do not meet certain quality requirements and
                        are improperly installed, they can be the cause of significant heat losses, condensation, mold
                        and poor comfort in the home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The loss of heat through the windows is transferable, ie through a closed window and ventilation
                        and through an open window. When both are collected, more than 50% of the total heat loss of the
                        building is realized through the windows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are different types of windows and their coefficients of thermal conductivity range from
                        0.8 W / m2K with the best windows with triple glass and gas filling to 3.5 W / m2K in old wooden
                        windows. It is recommended that the overall heat transfer coefficient does not exceed 1.8 W /
                        m2K.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quality windows reduce the transmission of heat loss, and losses through ventilation can be
                        reduced by installing ventilation systems. In this way, ventilation losses are reduced.

                    <h3>ADVANTAGES OF A PROPERLY INSTALLED NEW, ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCT:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>reduces energy consumption and saves money,</li>
                        <li>increases comfort in the home,</li>
                        <li>reduces condensation on windows in cold weather,</li>
                        <li>reduces noise penetration.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        High quality windows, doors and skylights are much more efficient than products 25 years ago.
                        They seal better, have low glass emissivity, inert gas or vacuum between the glasses and better
                        designed frames.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Energy-efficient products make the home more comfortable, because there is no draft, the indoor
                        air has higher humidity in the heating season, and in the summer the freshness is maintained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RIn order to make it easier for consumers to choose and to guarantee that they have chosen a
                        quality product, it is already a practice for carpentry to be certified and carry appropriate
                        labels that confirm their characteristics.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A CERTIFIED PRODUCT THAT HAS A QUALITY LABEL SATISFIES THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Double or triple glazing, with sealed insulating glass panel</li>
                        <li>Low emissivity glass</li>
                        <li>Filling the glass with argon or krypton</li>
                        <li>Low conductivitys</li>
                        <li>Good sealing</li>

                    <h3>INSTALLATION OF CARPENTRY</h3>
                    <p>
                        Joinery (windows, doors, skylights) should be installed by skilled persons, according to the
                        manufacturer's instructions. Poorly installed products (even if the product itself is of good
                        quality) do not work properly and can create cold drafts, water leaks, mechanism breakdown and
                        window deformation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>ECO CREDITS</h3>
                    <p>
                        GEFF is a program that helps households invest in highly efficient technologies by providing
                        financial resources through local banks that are partners in the Program, and the opportunity to
                        return the investment in the amount of 15-20% of the value of the products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The products offered by Vectro pro are energy efficient and have all the necessary quality
                        certificates, energy efficient and safe products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OptiWindow, in cooperation with the banks and the EBRD Program - WB GEFF, allows you to install
                        high-quality energy-efficient products
                        with an Eco loan taken from a bank and the possibility of returning the investment of 15-20% of
                        the total value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On average, households spend almost 50% of their annual energy costs on heating and cooling.
                        Investing in energy-efficient products in a house or apartment insulation, windows and doors,
                        boilers, heat pumps,
                        solar collectors / solar collectors for hot water, photovoltaic systems, lighting, ventilation,
                        air conditioning,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        storage boiler for hot water reduces unnecessary energy consumption.
                        In this way, households have direct financial savings. In addition to saving energy and money,
                        energy efficient products
                        improve people's living standards and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as CO2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if we take an uninsulated house with old windows that has an area of ​​100 m2, and the house is heated with electricity, and we make an investment in thermal insulation of the external walls with 10 cm and insulation of the roof with 20 cm, while replacing the old windows with energy efficient, then we can make financial savings in heating up to 1000 EUR per year.
