                            The company OptiWindow DOOEL Skopje is privately owned. The owner and manager of the company is Mr. Zlatko Spasoski. The headquarters and the production plant are located in Volkovo street, and the showroom is located at 1 Varshavska street (in the Nastel Taftalidze Karposh building)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After 10 years of successful operation on the market in the exhibition hall which was located at 70 b Partizanski ul. in the city of Alumnika in Karposh, on June 16/2021 in the presence of its business partners, associates and customers, the new showroom was solemnly opened at 1 Varshavska St. in the Nastel building, Taftalidze.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The showroom is well-appointed and easily accessible, with an exhibition space of about 100 square meters where customers can view the products on display. There are window systems with classic opening, to those that meet the strict requirements of passive objects, as well as sliding systems - lift-and-slide systems that are distinguished by a minimalist design and superior features. Of course, here you can also look at a wide selection of entrance security doors for houses or apartments, which, in addition to the basic function, are designed to refine the space and give a completely new dimension to everyone's home.  
                        </p>
